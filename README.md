# Different type of databases: Their functionality and purpose and the way they store data is different.
1. Sql database: like postgres, mysql -> Store data in tables and have a very strict schema -> Best for storing sensitive data and making sure that schema is correct.
2. Document database: like mongodb, dynamodb -> Store data in documents and do not have schema.
3. Key-value pair database: like redis -> Store data in key-value pairs => they are faster in retrieval of data. -> Best fo caching.

4. Graph database: They are used when our application has a lot of relationships... Like Twitter... e.x: we have a relationship between a tweet and users who like that tweet, also a relationship between a tweet and its creator account. => So many relationship... We can also use sql dbs and document dbs but if relationships are so cumbersome, it's better to store them in a graph db since it's focus is on storing data and their relationships... 

## How data is stored inside a graph db? data is stored in nodes(a circle). -> a node can be a food, a laptop, a building, a person etc. -> we might have several nodes to store names of different players. ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/f0ce41de-1bed-4d6a-b32e-5a836e3ed661)
## We can also store other data.. below we have stored team names of above players: ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/905101e6-9e69-46ad-9680-9bf5aa490509)
## Now we can relate these nodes together... Notice that they have a one way relation (Russel playes for Lakers team): ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/26b0939e-8ab5-4ba7-92e8-a6d35442bc88)

## Here we added some other relationships... Lebron is a teammate to Russel and also Russel is a teammate to LeBron: ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/88c47ab9-d4fe-4821-b3c1-f2160a936a98)

## Each node has several properties: ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/a02d26c8-9599-48a9-9b03-664270ef5932)

## To distinguish nodes from each other, we give them a label: (name and player label): ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/c9d6e32c-c01f-44c9-8e47-7460dedcb3b9)

## Now we create the relationship... one good thing is that we can give properties to the relationship: (Lebron has 40M salary in Lakers team): ![image](https://github.com/negarmiralaie/neo4js-guide/assets/81822434/f3d54eb5-7aee-4fbd-b97d-cdac20daf43e)

-----------------------------------------
##### Neo4j has Cypher query language. -> Like sql for graph data

-----------------------------------------

### In Neo4js, we can store 2 types of things:
1. node: entity... like a player or a team
2. relationship between nodes...

------------------------------------------

1. MATCH : The keyword to query for things. We always start with this keyword when we want to fetch data.

MATCH (n) => Take all of the nodes inside the application
RETURN n  => Return those nodes.
MATCH (n) RETURN n => Return all nodes

To get all players only
Match (n) RETURN 

-------------------------------------------
#### Each type in your GraphQL type definitions can be mapped to an entity in your Neo4j database.
##### The most basic mapping is of GraphQL types to Neo4j nodes, where the GraphQL type name maps to the Neo4j node label.



--------------------------------------------
1. Open neo4j desktop -> create a project
2. Click on +Add button to add a local DBMS
3. Set a password for the DBMS
4. Click on start btn to activate db.
5. Then click on Start -> To open neo4j browser.

------------------------------------------
##### Yes, you can definitely have multiple routes in a GraphQL project. It's just that with GraphQL, all requests (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) are usually sent to a single endpoint, often /graphql. This is different from REST APIs, where you have separate endpoints for different resources. However, this doesn't mean that you cannot have multiple endpoints in a GraphQL server. It's just not the common practice.

------------------------------------------
###### Instead of using Express routes (app.get and app.post) to handle GraphQL queries and mutations, you should be using GraphQL resolvers.
 ------------------------------------------
 ##### With @neo4j/graphql, you don't have to write resolvers for CRUD operations because they are autogenerated based on your type definitions. However, you can specify custom resolvers if you want additional behaviors


-------------------------------------------
#### In GraphQL, there are two main types of types: special types and custom types.

##### Special Types: These are types that have a special meaning in the GraphQL schema. There are three special types:
1. Query: This is the root type for all read operations. Any data that you fetch from your server is done through a query. When a client sends a query to the server, the server executes the query and returns the requested data.
2. Mutation: This is the root type for all write operations. Any data that you send to your server to create, update, or delete is done through a mutation. When a client sends a mutation to the server, the server executes the mutation, modifies the data, and returns the modified data.
4. Subscription: This is the root type for all real-time operations. Subscriptions allow the server to push updates to the client whenever data changes.
##### Custom Types: These are types that you define to represent the shape of your data. You can define as many custom types as you need, and each custom type can have as many fields as you want. In your case, Todo is a custom type that represents a todo item. It has three fields: id, title, and completed.
#### The main difference between special types and custom types is their purpose. Special types define the operations that can be performed (fetching data, modifying data, receiving real-time updates), while custom types define the shape of the data that those operations work with.
-------------------------------------------
> In typedefs, there are several things you are supposed to define:
    1. Custom types like (type User) or (type Todo) -> Representing your entities.
    2. type Query: -> This actually says that if user requested (users), you should return an array of Users.
    3. type mutation: Includes functions to work with entities, like a function to add a user to db, or a function to get all todos in db.
> Note that these code actually are written instead of defining routes in rest api.
